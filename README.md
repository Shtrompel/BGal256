My collection of modules for the VCV Rack virtual modular synthersizer app.

![Demo Gif](https://github.com/Shtrompel/BGal256/blob/main/demo.gif)

## Documentation 

The documantation is available in a different repository (here)[https://github.com/Shtrompel/BGal256ModulesDocs/blob/main/README.md].

## Building

The building steps follow the official buildings steps (as written in the manual)[https://vcvrack.com/manual/Building#Building-Rack-plugins].

A short summery of them (Assuming VCV is installed and the RACK_DIR environment path has been set):
```
git clone https://github.com/Shtrompel/BGal256.git
cd ./BGal256
make install
```
